                    <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
							<p>
                    <h4>Voting</h4> 
We're looking for a diverse group of Sophomores from all areas of Stuy. No matter what you do at Stuy, you just need a few qualifications. We're looking for people that are motivated to help, willing to express their opinions, and are willing to stand up for what's right. When we have an event, we need a council to vote on the who, what, when, where, why, & how. When we want to push for a policy change, we need a council to help us decide how we should go about the change. We need people that are willing to help us change the school, and openly express their opinions on various issues.

                    <h4>Suggestions</h4>
It's impossible for two people to come up with ideas that will appeal to all 837 Sophomores. We're looking for creative people, people that constantly have ideas and understand what needs to be changes before everyone else notices. We're looking for people that recognize what needs to be improved and then will take the initiative to go ahead and do something to make the improvement. You're job is to come up with ideas, identify problems, and then relay that information to us. After that, you can help us get it done, or you can look for other problems that can be fixed.

                    <h4>Communication</h4>
There are 837 Sophomores. We have initiatives, such as mailing lists, and Facebook Pages, but sometimes we need Grassroots movements. It's not always an instinct that if a problem arises, people will go to the Sophomore Caucus. People don't instantly recognize that we can make a difference in how their Stuy life goes. We need outgoing people that talk to various people and recognize problems that they talk about. Your job is to relay that information to us to we can make a difference. 

                    <hr>
                    
                    <h4>Events</h4>
We plan to have a ton of events next year, we want to have everything from Movie Nights to a Sophomore Trip. We can't make all of these decisions by ourselves though, we need you to help us make these decisions. We need people that are enthusiastic, and are excited to bring their ideas to the table. We need people that are willing to step up and make their opinions clear. That will help us get a bigger view as to what we should be doing vs. what we are doing for the events.
